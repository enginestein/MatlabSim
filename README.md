## Installation

To use MatlabSim, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. The simulations provided in this repository are compatible with MATLAB versions R2016b and above.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MatlabSim.git
   ```

2. Launch MATLAB and navigate to the `MatlabSim` directory.

That's it! You are now ready to use the simulations.

## Usage

Each simulation is contained in its own MATLAB script file (.m). To run a simulation, follow these steps:

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `MatlabSim` directory.
2. Choose the simulation you want to run from the list of available scripts.
3. Open the chosen simulation script in MATLAB's editor.
4. Run the script by clicking on the "Run" button or by typing `run` in the MATLAB command window.

The simulation will start running, and you can interact with it using the controls provided or by following the instructions displayed in the MATLAB command window.
